          models</h4>

        <p> Customers represent the most important assets of a firm. Customer lifetime value (CLV) allows assessing
          their current and future value in a customer base. The customer relationship management strategy and marketing
          resource allocation are based on this metric. Managers therefore need to predict the retention but also the
          purchase behavior of their customers. For every Marketing team, mission is to improve every human interaction
          via data science. Usually a firm has a lot of data on touches. Customers send billions of events representing
          user and customer behaviors (e.g.logging into an app, buying something, visiting a website, etc.) a month via
          websites, APIs that are validated, normalized and stored in realtime. Here, I try to predict future purchasing
          from a history of such customer transactions. </p>

            Prediction</a></h3>

        <p> The objective of this project is to create a model to predict the number of retweets a tweet will get on
          Twitter. The data used to train the model will be approximately 2,400 tweets each from 38 major banks and
          mobile network operators across Africa. A machine learning model to predict retweets would be valuable to any
          business that uses social media to share important information and messages to the public. This model can be
          used as a tool to help businesses better tailor their tweets to ensure maximum impact and outreach to clients
          and non-clients. </p>
